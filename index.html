              <h3>Programming</h3>
              <p>While getting my undergraduate degree in Industrial Engineering, I took classes in both VBA and MATLAB.
              These courses made me realize my love for building things with just my mind and a computer. Since then,
              I have become very interested in learning new languages and using this knowledge for career advancement and game development.</p>
              <p>Skilled in - Python, VBA, HTML5, CSS3, & MATLAB</p>
              <p>Learning - C++, Java, Swift, Javascript, Unreal Game Engine</p>

              <h3>Powerlifting</h3>
              <p>I have been lifting weights since age 17, when I started going to the gym to compliment my swimming
              goals. Since then, I have come a long way and focused my efforts on the top strength movements. I am currently
              running a powerlifting program, and I am planning to compete for the first time in November 2023.</p>
              <p>Current - Squat: 425, Bench: 293, Deadlift: 502</p>
              <p>Goals - Squat: 465, Bench: 305, Deadlift: 585</p>
